Welcome to the Sudoku Solver project! This Java program is capable of solving any given Sudoku puzzle using efficient algorithms.

It aims to solve solve sudoku puzzles with a variety of different constraints while making it easy to explore the solution space including:

- Iterating over the solutions.
- Seeing all possible values a cell can take.
- Stepping through the solving process.

## I. Introduction
This project provides a Java implementation of a Sudoku solver. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find the solution for any valid Sudoku puzzle.

## II. Usage
To use the Sudoku solver, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
   git clone https://github.com/shaquib82/SudokuSolver.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   cd SudokuSolver

3. Compile the Java files: 
   javac SudokuSolver.java

4. Run the solver with a Sudoku puzzle input file: 
   java SudokuSolver <input_file>
   Replace `<input_file>` with the path to your Sudoku puzzle input file.
